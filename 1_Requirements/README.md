# REQUIREMENTS

# INTRODUCTION: 
* The Electricity Cost Calculator project is an application-based micro project that predicts the following month's electricity bill based on the appliances or loads used. Visual studio code was used to write the code for this project. This project employs a multi-file and multi-platform strategy (Linux and Windows).

# RESEARCH

* People who haven't had depth of understanding of calculating power bills can use this package to forecast their electricity bills for the coming months; however, an electricity bill calculator must have the following features:

* All loads' power rating
* Unit consumed per day units produced per month total load calculation
* In addition, high-end power bill calculators usually incorporate the following features:

* In metropolitan locations, how do you calculate your electricity bill?
* In rural areas, electricity bills are calculated depending on the number of units utilised.

# Defining System:

* Using a testing algorithm, design and test the operations of an electricity bill calculator.

# SWOT analysis:

* Strengths: Innovative, User-friendly.

* Weakness: Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase.

* Opportunities: We know that we mostly use pen and paper for calculation. So tech based market always attracts the youth.

* Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.

# 4’W and 1’H

* What: Electricity bill calculator

* Where: School, Science, domestic, industries, Technology

* When: Need for calculation.

* How: Calculates the user input as number of loads and gives the output.
