# Project Goal

* Project entitled “Electricity Billing System” aims is to generate
electricity bill with all the charges and penalty. Manual system that is
employed is extremely laborious and quite inadequate. It only makes
the process more difficult and hard. 
* The aim of this project is to develop a system that is meant to
partially computerize the work performed in the Electricity Board like
generating monthly electricity bill, record of consuming unit of energy,
store record of the customer and previous unpaid record. 
* We used Microsoft Visual Basic for developing our project. Visual Basic is primarily
a visual design environment. We can create a VB application by
designing the form and that make up the user interface. Adding visual
basic application code to the form and the objects such as buttons and
text boxes on them and adding any required support code in additional
modular.

## Advantages

* The overall project report is divided into some parts. These parts are
further divided into their subparts. In the parts we have described the
purpose, scope of the project, objective of the project i.e. approach
which used for developing this software. It includes the topics like the
problems with the existing system and the functionality of the
organization. Introduction to tools, design, coding, testing and
debugging of the system are discussed in very detail. We have also
provided the names of the books from which we have taken guidance
to complete the work. Last section contains the matter about the overall
work performed and the efforts taken to complete the project.

# INTRODUCTION: 
* The Electricity Cost Calculator project is an application-based micro project that predicts the following month's electricity bill based on the appliances or loads used. Visual studio code was used to write the code for this project. This project employs a multi-file and multi-platform strategy (Linux and Windows).

# RESEARCH

* People who haven't had depth of understanding of calculating power bills can use this package to forecast their electricity bills for the coming months; however, an electricity bill calculator must have the following features:

* All loads' power rating
* Unit consumed per day units produced per month total load calculation
* In addition, high-end power bill calculators usually incorporate the following features:

* In metropolitan locations, how do you calculate your electricity bill?
* In rural areas, electricity bills are calculated depending on the number of units utilised.

# Defining System:

* We can use this system and find the electic bills using testing algorithm, design and test the operations of an electricity bill calculator and we can make the interface user friendly ao that even the people who have less technical skills could also understand.

# SWOT analysis:

* Strengths: Innovative, User-friendly.

* Weakness: Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase.

* Opportunities: We know that we mostly use pen and paper for calculation. So tech based market always attracts the youth.

* Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.

# 5’W and 1’H

* Who: To impove the people's life

* What: Calculator for electricity bills

* Where: Science, Domestic, Industry, and Technology

* When: Calculation are needed.

* Why: To make electric bill calculations handy

* How: Calculates the amount of loads entered by the user and displays the result.
